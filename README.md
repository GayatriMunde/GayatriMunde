# 👋 Hello, I'm Gayatri

“Code for impact. Design with empathy.”

I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development with a flair for user-centric design and focused on transitioning into product management, where I can blend strategy, user research, and execution to create products that matter. I’m particularly drawn to human-centered design, automation, and accessibility, ensuring that technology works for people, not the other way around.
